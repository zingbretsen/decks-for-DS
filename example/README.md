Anki accepts LaTeX and HTML markup inside the cards. The Bayes Theorem example deck shows a simple example of both. HTML should not be used inside the LaTeX tags.

Open the Anki desktop program. Go to your Decks, and click Import File. Load the bayes.txt file.

Type: Basic
Deck: Bayes Theorem (You will have to create this deck)

Anki should automatically detect that the sides of the card are separated by a semi-colon.

Click "Allow HTML in fields" to allow HTML, then import the deck.

Two cards should now show up in the Bayes Theorem deck when you go to study.
